## Bug Bounty

We're opening up a live bug bounty program to encourage responsible security research and battle-test our contracts in the real world. Weâ€™re inviting white hat hackers, tinkerers, and security researchers to probe our account implementation.

### Capture the Funds

- **Porto smart account** deployed on Base mainnet, funded with **1 ETH**
- Regular operations include: upgrades, signing, execution
- **Open challenge:** Anyone may attempt to drain the account. If successful, **you keep the funds**

**Account Address:** `0xb4B87c22950eD0f3D83aabd3dE20009bA9b16DF1`  
**Chain ID:** `8453`
