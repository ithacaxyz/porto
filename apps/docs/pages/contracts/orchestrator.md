# Orchestrator
The Orchestrator is a privileged contract that facilitates trustless interactions between the relay and the account.

## Intent 
The orchestrator accepts executions in the form of an intent. 

An `intent` struct contains all the relevant data that allows a 3rd party like the relay to make an execution on behalf of the user, and get paid for it.

The intent has to be signed by one of the [Keys](./account.md#keys) authorized in the user's account. Optionally, the intent can use a `paymaster` to pay on behalf of the user, in which case the intent also needs to be signed by the paymaster.

```

Let's go through each of these fields, to discuss the features enabled by intents.

### Gas Abstraction

One of the most powerful use cases of executing through intents is that backend relays can abstract gas for users and get compensated in any token the user holds.

We've eliminated the concept of `gas refunds`, and made `prePayment` optional.

Here's how the flow works:

1. The user sends their calls to the relay.
2. The relay analyzes the calls and determines the amount they want to be paid, in the `paymentToken` specified in the intent.
3. The relay can run sophisticated griefing checks to assess risk. Based on this, they split the total payment between `prePayment` and `postPayment`.
4. The relay can also set the `supportedAccountImplementation` field in the intent when sending it onchain, to reduce the risk of the user frontrunning them by upgrading their account.

If the `postPayment` fails, the user's entire execution is reverted. This ensures users cannot exploit the system to get free executions.

:::warning
Beyond this, the contracts do not provide native griefing protection. It is up to the relay to simulate the call and evaluate the risk associated with each intent.

Relays may choose to:
- Only support accounts that follow ERC-4337 validation rules.
- Charge the full fee as `postPayment` if they fully trust the user.
:::

We leave the decision of how to split the payment between `prePayment` and `postPayment` entirely to each relay.

Our recommendations:

1. Including both `prePayment` and `postPayment` in an intent introduces an extra ERC20 transfer, increasing gas costs. This tradeoff should be considered.
2. Relays should build sophisticated offchain griefing defenses, such as reputation systems and risk premiums for new users.
3. Charging only via `postPayment` allows the user to start execution without upfront funds. This enables use cases where funds become available only after the callâ€”e.g., after withdrawing from a DApp.

:::note
There is no `postPayment` field in the intent. Post payment is calculated as `totalPayment - prePayment`.
This is done to make the EIP-712 struct more explicit and readable.

### Paymasters
On the topic of payments, DApps might want to sponsor payments for their users. 
This means that instead of the payment to the relay being collected from the user's porto account, it can be collected from any third-party contract that implements the [pay()](./account.md#1-pay) function.

To sponsor an intent, you just need to set the `payer` field to the paymaster contract's address. 

:::note
If left empty, the payer field is substituted with the intent's eoa address. 

This is done for a gas optimization, related to calldata compression.
:::

We've allowed porto accounts to act as paymasters for other porto accounts. This makes it extremely simple to spin up paymasters to sponsor gas for your users.

### Execution
The intent contains the following execution information:

##### nonce
Same as the nonce mechanic detailed [here](./account.md#nonce-management) in the account.
All nonces are stored and incremented in the storage of the account. The orchestrator just has special privilege to access these storage slots.

##### executionData
Since all the data like nonce and signature is added in their corresponding fields in the intent. 
The executionData requires no additional `opData` and uses the `0x0100...` single batch encoding described [here](./account.md#modes).

### Account Creation 
We currently use PREP to initialize provably rootless 7702 accounts. 
All the initialization data goes in the `initData` field.
