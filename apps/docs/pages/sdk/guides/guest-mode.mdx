# Guest Mode

Guest mode allows users to send transactions without pre-connecting a wallet. Porto automatically handles the account connection flow when the transaction is submitted.

This reduces friction and improves conversion rates by allowing users to preview actions before deciding to create or connect a wallet.

</GuideDemoContainer>

## How It Works

When `account: null` is set in a transaction call, Porto intercepts the request and prompts the user to create or connect an account only when needed.

```tsx twoslash [Send.tsx]
import * as React from 'react'
const tokenAddress = '' as Address
const recipient = '' as Address
// ---cut---
import { erc20Abi, parseUnits, type Address } from 'viem'
import { writeContract } from 'viem/actions'
import { useClient } from 'wagmi'


export function Send() {
  const client = useClient()

  async function handleSend() {
    await writeContract(client!, {
      abi: erc20Abi,
      account: null, // let Porto handle the account connection
      address: tokenAddress,
      functionName: 'transfer',
      args: [recipient, parseUnits('10', 18)],
    })
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleSend}>
      Send
    </button>
  )
}
```
