# Fee Sponsoring

A Porto Merchant (Sponsor) Account lets your app pay gas on behalf of users.
It is an admin-controlled account that, via your Merchant RPC server,
designates itself as the fee payer and signs fee payments for user calls.
This flow allows you to sponsor or subsidize any transaction fee.

## Usage

- Expose a Merchant RPC endpoint that inspects requests and attaches fee sponsorship
- (Optional) If your server is remote, pass `merchantRpcUrl` to `Porto.create()`
- You can add conditional rules with the `sponsor` option to control when fees are covered

The guide below will show you how to set up a Merchant RPC server and how to use it with Porto
using a Cloudflare Worker, but you can also use any other server framework (Next.js, Deno, Express, etc).

## Template

We will base this guide off the following template:

```bash
pnpx gitpick ithacaxyz/porto/tree/main/examples/sponsoring-vite
```

:::note
We also have a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) example at:

```bash
pnpx gitpick ithacaxyz/porto/tree/main/examples/sponsoring-next.js
```

:::

## Steps

::::steps

### Connect Account

Follow the [Onboard & Discover Accounts](/sdk/guides/discover-accounts) guide to get this set up.

### Set up Merchant Account

Run the following command to onboard a new Porto Merchant (Sponsor) Account.

```sh
pnpx porto onboard -a
```

Place the address and private key of the merchant account into the `.dev.vars` file.

```sh
MERCHANT_ADDRESS=0x...
MERCHANT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

### Set up Merchant RPC Server

Next, we will set up our Merchant RPC Server at the `/rpc` endpoint of our app.
See the [`MerchantRpc`](/sdk/api/merchantRpc/requestHandler) API reference for more details.

```ts
import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'
import { MerchantRpc } from 'porto/server'

export default {
  fetch: MerchantRpc.requestHandler({
    address: env.MERCHANT_ADDRESS,
    base: '/rpc',
    key: env.MERCHANT_PRIVATE_KEY,
    // Optionally handle which requests should be sponsored.
    // sponsor(request) {
    //   return true
    // },
  }),
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>
```

:::note
If your server is at a different location to your app, you will need to pass the URL
to it on `Porto.create(){:js}`.

```ts twoslash  
import { Porto } from 'porto'

const porto = await Porto.create({
  merchantRpcUrl: 'https://myapi.com/rpc'
})
```

:::

### Done

That's it! Once you have a server set up at the `/rpc` path of your app (or another remote URL),
Porto will route through this endpoint for future calls to perform (and sponsor) a transaction.
