import { Connect } from '../../components/Connect'

# Getting Started

## Overview

The Porto SDK is a TypeScript library designed for Applications and Wallets to create, manage, and 
interact with universal next-gen accounts on Ethereum.

Try signing into your account:

<Connect />

## Install

Porto is available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/porto) under `porto`

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i porto
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i porto
```

```bash [bun]
bun i porto
```

:::

## Usage

You can get started with Porto by creating a new instance with `Porto.create(){:ts}`

```ts
import { Porto } from 'porto'

Porto.create()
```

This will internally inject a Porto instance into your Application via [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963).
Modern Wallet Connection libraries will automatically detect the injected instance.

Supported wallet connection libraries include:

- [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh)
- [Privy](https://privy.io)
- [AppKit](https://reown.com/appkit)
- [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz)
- [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com)
- [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com)

:::tip
If you wish to use Porto directly, without relying on Wallet Connection libraries, you can use Porto's [EIP-1193 `provider` instance](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193).

```ts twoslash
import { Porto } from 'porto'

const porto = Porto.create()

const { accounts } = await porto.provider.request({ 
  method: 'wallet_connect'
})
```

### Usage with Wagmi

Porto can be used in conjunction with [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to provide a seamless experience for developers and end-users.

::::steps

#### 1. Set up Wagmi

Get started with Wagmi by following the [official guide](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started).

#### 2. Set up Porto

After you have set up Wagmi, you can set up Porto by using the `porto(){:ts}` connector.

```ts [wagmi.ts] twoslash
import { porto } from 'porto/wagmi' // [!code ++]
import { http, createConfig, createStorage } from 'wagmi'
import { baseSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains'

export const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
  chains: [baseSepolia],
  connectors: [porto()], // [!code ++]
  storage: createStorage({ storage: localStorage }),
  transports: {
    [baseSepolia.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

#### 3. Use Porto

This means you can now use Wagmi-compatible Hooks like `useConnect`. For more info, check out the [Wagmi Reference](#TODO).

```tsx twoslash
import * as React from 'react'
// ---cut---
import { useConnect, useConnectors } from 'wagmi'

function Connect() {
  const connect = useConnect()
  const connectors = useConnectors()

  return connectors?.map((connector) => (
    <button
      key={connector.uid}
      onClick={() => connect.connect({ connector })}
    >
      Connect
    </button>
  ))
}
```

:::tip
You can also use a pre-existing [Wallet Connection library](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/connect-wallet#third-party-libraries) to handle the connection logic for your users.
