# Getting Started

## Overview

The Porto SDK is a TypeScript library designed for Applications and Wallets to create, manage, and 
interact with universal next-gen accounts on Ethereum.

Try signing into your account:

<Connect />

## Install

Porto is available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/porto) under `porto`

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i porto
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i porto
```

```bash [bun]
bun i porto
```

## Wagmi Usage

Porto is best used in conjunction with [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to provide a seamless experience for developers and end-users.

::::steps

### 1. Set up Wagmi

Get started with Wagmi by following the [official guide](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started).

### 2. Set up Porto

After you have set up Wagmi, you can set up Porto by using the `porto(){:ts}` connector.

```ts [wagmi.ts] twoslash
import { porto } from 'porto/wagmi' // [!code ++]
import { http, createConfig, createStorage } from 'wagmi'
import { baseSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains'

export const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
  chains: [baseSepolia],
  connectors: [porto()], // [!code ++]
  storage: createStorage({ storage: localStorage }),
  transports: {
    [baseSepolia.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

:::tip
If you are using a Wallet Connection library and cannot supply a custom connector,
you can use `Porto.create()` to create a new instance of Porto, and inject itself
into the Wallet Connection library via [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963).

```ts
import { Porto } from 'porto'

Porto.create()
```

Supported Wallet Connection libraries include: [Privy](https://privy.io), [AppKit](https://reown.com/appkit), [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz), [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com), [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com).

### 3. Use Porto

This means you can now use Wagmi-compatible Hooks like `useConnect`. 

See [Wagmi Reference](/sdk/wagmi) for a set of compatible Wagmi Hooks.

```tsx twoslash
import * as React from 'react'
// ---cut---
import { useConnect, useConnectors } from 'wagmi'

function Connect() {
  const connect = useConnect()
  const connectors = useConnectors()

  return connectors?.map((connector) => (
    <button
      key={connector.uid}
      onClick={() => connect.connect({ connector })}
    >
      Connect
    </button>
  ))
}
```


::::

## Vanilla Usage

You can get started with Porto by creating a new instance with `Porto.create(){:ts}`.

Once set up, you can use the `provider` instance to interact with Porto.

```ts
import { Porto } from 'porto'

const porto = Porto.create()

const { accounts } = await porto.provider.request({ 
  method: 'wallet_connect'
})
```

See [RPC Reference](/sdk/rpc) for a list of all available methods.

## Secure Origins (HTTPS)

Porto is designed to be used on secure origins (HTTPS). If you are using HTTP,
Porto will fallback to using a popup instead of an iframe. This is because
WebAuthn is not supported on iframes embedded on insecure origins (HTTP).

Web frameworks typically default to HTTP in development environments. You
will need to ensure to turn on HTTPS in development to leverage the Porto iframe.

### Vite

HTTPS can be enabled on Vite's dev server by installing and configuring the `vite-plugin-mkcert` plugin.

```bash
npm i vite-plugin-mkcert
```

```ts [vite.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import mkcert from 'vite-plugin-mkcert' // [!code ++]

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    mkcert(), // [!code ++]
    react(),
  ],
})
```

### Next.js

HTTPS can be enabled on Next.js' dev server by setting the `--experimental-https` flag on the `next dev` command.

```bash
next dev --experimental-https
```
